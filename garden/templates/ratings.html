<h3>Rating system</h3>

<p>Anything with a rating uses an integer from 1 to 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>7 — Perfect, must try, life-changing, go out of your way to seek this out
<li>6 — Excellent, worth repeating
<li>5 — Good, don’t go out of your way, but enjoyable
<li>4 — Passable, works in a pinch
<li>3 — Bad, don’t do this if you can
<li>2 — Atrocious, actively avoid, repulsive
<li>1 — Evil, life-changing in a bad way
</ul>

<p>Why this scale? I like rating out of 7 better than 4 or 5 because I need more granularity at the top, for the good experiences, and 10 is too granular.</p>
