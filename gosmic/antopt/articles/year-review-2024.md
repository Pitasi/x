2024 is coming to an end. A lot happened in my life.

Starting at the end of 2023: I got married, I moved to a different country, and
at the beginning of 2024 I started working on a new project.

The past 12 months have been a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with
challenges that I won't discuss here. What I'll do instead, is to share a few
accomplishments (or, in some cases, a few failures).

- I got married in October 2023 üíç
- I moved to a different country in December 2023 üá™üá∏
- ...and had to deal with all the bureaucracy
- Attended nearly all [Go MAD](https://www.meetup.com/go-mad/) meetups
- ...where I also gave a talk about Tendermint and distributed systems ([slides](https://anto.pt/gomad24))
- I didn't write more notes, nor truly started a second brain: miserably failed
as I'm really bad at being consistent with taking notes, review and organize
them, and make them useful.
- I quit my job in January 2024 to start a new project! Which leads me to
- Growth in my career, in non-technical areas. While I still want to be a
deeply technical person, I assumed leadership roles out of my comfort zone.
- I travelled a lot, to get back to my family, to go on vacation, but also to
partecipate in a lot of conferences:
  * [FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/), Brussels (see you again in a few weeks!)
  * [EthCC](https://ethcc.io), Brussels
  * [Token2024](https://token2049.com), Singapore
  * [Cosmoverse 2024](https://cosmoverse.org), Dubai
  * [Golab 2024](https://golab.io), Firenze
- Like we always do, we promise to write more in our personal blogs. While
I wrote some of them, I still have a long way to go before being satisfied.
- I did take more seriously my photography. With the intent of getting better I
watched countless tutorials and shoot a lot of photos. It's only a mere hobby,
but it gets me out of my house.
- I read more books, mostly novels but also some non-fiction ones. The
highlights are:
  * the Broken Earth series, N. K. Jemisin
  * The Three-Body Problem, Liu Cixin
  * Project Hail Mary, Andy Weir


All in all, I'm pretty tired, but I'm also happy with the progress I made.
Let's see what 2025 brings!
