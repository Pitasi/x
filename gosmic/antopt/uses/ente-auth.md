An open source app for 2FA codes.

Replaced Authy, after they decided to close down their
desktop app and the APIs integration.

If you're still using Authy, you are locked with them.
Ente Auth allows for export and imports of authentication
codes, without having to manually go through all the
websites and reconfigure them.
